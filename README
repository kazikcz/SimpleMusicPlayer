SimpleMusicPlayer
-----------------

SMP is a minimalistic music player for the Android system. It is queue list
oriented. It does not store any permanent data.

SMP is divided into two parts:
 - UI
 - backend

The backend is a Service and is destroyed only when the user explicitly quits
using 'exit' in option menu. It also may be destroyed by the system under
memory pressure. The playback will be paused when an incomming call occurs, an
outgoing call is dialed/ongoing, headset plug is disconnected.  The playback is
restored when according event is reversed (i.e. pluging back the headset will
resume the playback only when the original reason for pausing was headset
unplugging).

SMP is licensed under the terms of 2-clause BSD License (aka ,,Simplified BSD
License'').

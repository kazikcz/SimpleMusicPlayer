SimpleMusicPlayer
-----------------

SMP is a minimalistic music player for the Android system. It is enqueue list
oriented. It does not store any permanent data.

SMP is divided into two parts:
 - UI
 - backend

The backend is a Service and is destroyed only when the user quits the UI while
a playback is stopped. The playback will be paused when an incomming call
occurs, an outgoing call is dialed/ongoing, headset plug is disconnected. The
playback is restored when according event is reversed (i.e. pluging back the
headset will resume the playback only when the original reason for pausing was
headset unplugging).

SMP is licensed under the terms of 2-clause BSD License (aka ,,Simplified BSD
License'').
